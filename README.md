# HTML5 & JavaScript QR scanner powered by WebRTC
Simple-QR-scanner is based on [Instascan by Chris Schmich](https://github.com/schmich/instascan) which is powered by the [Emscripten JavaScript build](https://github.com/kig/zxing-cpp-emscripten) of the [C++ port](https://github.com/glassechidna/zxing-cpp) of the [ZXing Java library](https://github.com/zxing/zxing).
## Why it was created.
My 'version' of Instascan is optimized for mobile use, the preview of the camera is displayed full screen and the content decrypted from the QR code is shown right on the screen, no need for consoles or scrolling. I needed such a scanner for another project. As of July 2017 iOS devices are out of luck as Safari (but also Chrome and Firefox for iOS) will only be able to support WebRTC (a collection of communication protocols needed to access the camera) with iOS 11. A fallback (upload of image) for these devices might follow.
## Try it out!
You can try out the scanner [here](https://timmedia.github.io/simple-QR-scanner/). Please allow your brwoser to access your camera.
